楊尚樺教授發起的Taiwan THz workshop，這次輪到鄭宇翔在台大舉辦，時間為12/19(暫定早上10點到下午3點，可參加半場，但鼓勵全程參加)，地點為台大電機二館142室，歡迎大家一起來討論THz相關研究，跟老朋友當面聊，也認識新朋友。報名網址如下，希望來參加的人可以準備10分鐘的研究介紹(並非強制)，若方便可以先提供講題。有其他疑問都可以回信問我，謝謝。


The Taiwan THz workshop initiated by Professor Yang Shanghua is being organized by Yu-Hsiang Cheng at National Taiwan University this time. The event is scheduled for December 19 (tentatively from 10 AM to 3 PM; you can attend for half the time, but full attendance is encouraged). It will be held in Room 142 of the Electrical Engineering Building 2 at NTU. Everyone is welcome to come discuss THz-related research, chat with old friends, and meet new ones. The registration link is below. I hope those who plan to attend can prepare a 10-minute research presentation (which is not mandatory), and if convenient, please provide your topic in advance. If you have any other questions, feel free to reply to me. Thank you
