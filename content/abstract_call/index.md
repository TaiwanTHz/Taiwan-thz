# Presentation Guidelines

## Oral Presentation
Please arrive at the session meeting rooms 15 minutes earlier and reconfirm your presentation slides with workshop staffs. Workshop staffs will stay in session meeting rooms to provide relevant assistance accordingly. **All presentations must be presented in English**.
1. In every presentation, we will hold up a sign remind you that you have one more minute to enter the Q&A session. Once the Q&A session ends (5 mins later), we will remind you that time is up.
2. The presenter must load the presentation file onto the session room computer before the beginning of the session. In general, it is NOT suggested to connect your own computer to the projector in the session room.


## Poster Presentation
Presenters should arrive **15 minutes** earlier to set up their posters. <br>
The poster size is **A0 format (Width 84.1cm x Height 118.9cm)**. 

Presenters must be around their bulletin boards to make their presentations and answer questions during the poster sessions. Presenters who wish to keep their posters should remove them after the presentation. Any remaining posters will be removed by workshop staffs when the session ends.
