The 2025 Taiwan THz Summer Workshop will take place at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu, Taiwan, from June 26th to 28th, 2025. This workshop series originated in 2023 at National Tsing Hua University, and since then, it has been held five times, demonstrating a growing interest in the field. These workshops are designed to foster discussions on the latest developments and future directions in terahertz (THz) science and technology, as well as their applications across various disciplines. Topics covered will include cutting-edge research in experimental and theoretical approaches related to devices, spectroscopy, imaging, ultrafast phenomena, and communications. Furthermore, the workshop will explore applications from biology, chemistry, physics, material science, and electrical engineering. We invite researchers, practitioners, and students to engage in meaningful discussions and collaborate on innovative ideas during this exciting event.
